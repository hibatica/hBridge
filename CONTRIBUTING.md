# Contributing to hBridge

Please join my [discord](https://discord.gg/MdXnUTVHYZ) if you can for better coordination (optional)

If you would like to contribute, just fork this repo and submit pull requests when you're ready.

If you think you can do it better than me (including a complete rewrite), please contribute to this
project instead of maintaining your own fork. You can if you want to though.

I'm not the most knowledgeable as you might be able to tell, so any input and contribution is welcome!
